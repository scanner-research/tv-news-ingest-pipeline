COHEN TONIGHT WE LEARNED THAT SEAN

65
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,570
HANNITY ALSO USED THE LEGAL SERVICES OF

66
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,730
JAY SEKULOW SHOULD HE HAVE DISCLOSED

67
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,830

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,790
DISCLOSURE

69
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,520
WHEN IN DOUBT HAVING SAID THAT I DON'T

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,110
THINK ANYBODY BELIEVES THAT HANNITY

71
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,490
WOULD HAVE SAID OR DONE ANYTHING

72
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,070
DIFFERENT HAD HE NEVER MET MICHAEL COHEN

73
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,770
HAD HE NEVER MET JAY SACO HANNITY IS

74
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,230
HANNITY HE'S GONNA DO ANYTHING TO DEFEND

75
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,840
DONALD TRUMP INTO ATTACK MODE EVERYBODY

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,750
KNOWS THAT SO HE DIDN'T SUBSTANTIVELY

77
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,570
DECEIVE HIS AUDIENCE BUT HE SHOULD HAVE

78
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,300
MADE THE DISCLOSURE WHY DO YOU THINK

79
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,430
HE'S EMPLOYING SO MANY LAWYERS WHO ALSO

80
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,200
WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT OH BECAUSE THEY

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,770
ALL HAVE THE SAME INTEREST THEY ALL LOVE

82
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,980
DONALD TRUMP HE CAN DO NO WRONG AND

83
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,110
THEY'RE PART OF A CLUB I'M NOT PART OF

84
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,960
THAT CLUB YOU KNOW PEOPLE TRY TO LUMP ME

85
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,460
TOGETHER WITH THESE PEOPLE I AM AN

86
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,560
INDEPENDENT DEFENDER OF THE CONSTITUTION

87
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,590
I AM FREE TO CRITICIZE DONALD TRUMP AS I

88
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,600
HAVE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN TRUMP SENT OUT A

89
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,270
TWEET SAYING COMEÃ– TO GO TO JAIL I

90
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,490
RAILED AT PRESIDENT TRYING TO SAY YOU'RE

91
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,080
DOING THE SAME THING THEY'RE DOING TO

92
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,100
YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO CRIMINALIZE

93
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,990
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES NO COMEY OUGHT NOT

94
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,640
TO GO TO JAIL AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU

95
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,380
THERE IS SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT

96
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,270
THOUGH WHICH IS UNLIKE MOST AMERICANS

97
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,850
PERHAPS BECAUSE OF YOUR CAREER AND

98
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,250
STATUS YOU DO DINE WITH THE PRESIDENT

99
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,540
WHICH I BELIEVE YOU DID RECENTLY AND I

100
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,950
SAW ON FOX NEWS I'M GONNA PLAY THIS AS

101
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,570
WELL BECAUSE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

102
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,580
POINT YOU RAISED WHEN ASKED ABOUT ADVICE

103
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,680
TO THE PRESIDENT YOU EXPLAINED THE ONLY

104
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,970
WAY HE'S GONNA GET YOUR YOUR

105
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,140
QUOTE-UNQUOTE ADVICE TAKE A LOOK LOOK I

106
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,370
DON'T GIVE A ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT

107
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,050
EXCEPT ON TELEVISION IF HE WANTS TO

108
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,900
LISTEN HE CAN LISTEN IF HE'S WATCHING

109
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,790
FOX OR THE BEAT HE DOES HEAR FROM YOU

110
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,920
THOUGH WHAT WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,450
HE DO IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MULL

112
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,010
APPROACH WELL FIRST OF ALL I WAS ON

113
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,750
TELEVISION ABOUT CLINTON I'VE BEEN ON

114
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,700
TELEVISION ABOUT EVERYBODY WHO HAS BEEN

115
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,920
CHARGED WITH CRIME AND PEOPLE CAN LISTEN

116
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,110
OR NOT LISTEN LOOK WHAT I SAID ON

117
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,048
TELEVISION IS DON'T PARDON DON'T FIRE

118
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,358
DON'T TWEET AND DON'T TESTIFY VERY

119
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,579
SIMPLE ADVICE THAT'S FOR DON'T

120
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,530
WELL THE TESTIFYING IS REALLY IMPORTANT

121
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,000
BECAUSE WE NOW LEARNED A SECRET FROM

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,600
COMEY

123
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,430
HERE'S HIS SECRET HE SAID

124
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,889
WHY DID I WRITE AN EXONERATION LETTER OF

125
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,870
CLINTON BEFORE WE EVEN INTERVIEWED OH

126
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,449
WELL HE SAID AN INVESTIGATION WE MAKE UP

127
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,280
OUR MINDS FIRST WE FIGURE IT OUT AND

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,710
THEN WE BRING IN THE PERSON LIKE HILLARY

129
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,880
CLINTON WITH DONALD TRUMP

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,699
TO SEE IF THEY'RE GONNA LIE COMEY IS

131
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,680
TELLING TRUMP HE DID WRITE THAT IN THE

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,110
BRAIN THAT HE'S TELLING TRUMP IF YOU

133
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,850
COME AND TESTIFY IT'S ONLY BECAUSE WE

134
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,560
WANT TO PUT YOU IN A PERJURY TRAP THAT'S

135
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,509
A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT BUT WHY DONALD

136
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,009
TRUMP SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO SPECIAL

137
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,539
PROSECUTORS IF HE CAN AVOID IT

138
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,340
WELL PROSECUTORS AS YOU KNOW SAY THAT

139
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,169
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING TO DO A PERJURY TRAP

140
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,520
JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TEST SOMEONE'S

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,259
VERACITY LET ME PLAY SOMETHING ELSE TO

142
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,139
JAMES COMEY SAID THAT'S TURNING A LOT OF

143
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,759
HEADS AS HE'S ON THIS BOOK TOUR BECAUSE

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,539
HE IS OF COURSE INVOLVED IN THE MOLLER

145
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,110
PROBE HE'S A GERMAN MAJOR WITNESS AND NO

146
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,910
ONE CAN PREJUDGE WHAT THEY FIND AND WHAT

147
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,259
SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT I THINK AT THE

148
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,610
SERVICE AGENT ONE RESPONSIBLE AND YET

149
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,780
JAMES COMEY JUST SAID THIS I THINK

150
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,759
IMPEACHING AND REMOVING DONALD TRUMP

151
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,770
FROM OFFICE WOULD LET THE AMERICAN

152
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,300
PEOPLE OFF THE HOOK AND HAVE SOMETHING

153
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,430
HAPPEN INDIRECTLY THAT I BELIEVE THEIR

154
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,889
DUTIES BOUND TO DO DIRECTLY PEOPLE IN

155
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,050
THIS COUNTRY NEED TO STAND UP AND GO TO

156
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,340
THE VOTING BOOTH AND VOTE THEIR VALUES

157
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,320
DOES HE SHOW POOR JUDGMENT THIS WEEK IN

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,120
WEIGHING IN THAT WAY WHEN THE PROBE

159
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,430
ISN'T OVER AND HE'S A WITNESS ABSOLUTELY

160
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,750
AND IF I WERE DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYER

161
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,120
WHICH I'M NOT I WOULD BE JUMPING UP AND

162
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,310
DOWN FOR JOY ABOUT COMMIS BOOKED ORCAS

163
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,169
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE CROSS-EXAMINED AND

164
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,389
YOU LOVE TO CROSS-EXAMINE A WITNESS

165
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,000
WHO'S WRITTEN A BOOK WHO HAS MANUSCRIPTS

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,759
EARLIER DRAFTS OF THE BOOK WHO IS BEING

167
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,669
PAID TO WRITE THE BOOK IT IS THE JOY OF

168
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,550
A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS DAY WHEN HE

169
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,759
CAN GET TO CROSS-EXAMINE A WITNESS WHO'S

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,680
EXPOSED HIMSELF IN THIS IF YOU'RE RIGHT

171
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,199
THAT COMEY IS HURTING HIMSELF AND I HAVE

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
REPORTED ON THIS SHOW ABOUT SOME OF THE

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,190
APPARENT LAPSES IN JUDGMENT BASED ON HIS

174
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,169
OWN WRITINGS IN THE BOOK WHY DO YOU

175
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,820
THINK HE'S DOING THIS WELL I THINK HE

176
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,949
NEEDS TO BEN DECATUR HIMSELF LOOK I

177
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,659
UNDERSTAND BEING HATED BY BOTH SIDES

178
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,210
BELIEVE ME BUT HE'S BEING HATED WITH A

179
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,070

I DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION YOU KNOW I

188
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,090
STARTED WHEN I WAS IN BROOKLYN COLLEGE I

189
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,889
DEFENDED THE RIGHT OF COMMUNISTS TO

190
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,780

MARCH THROUGH SKOKIE THEY CALL ME A NAZI

194
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,759
I DEFENDED THE RIGHTS OF UNPOPULAR

CRIMINALS I'M A MURDERER

196
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,259

197
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,289
ENEMIES OF MCCARTHYISM ARE REALLY

198
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,150

THEY ESTABLISHED THE PRECEDENTS AND THEY

202
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,849
USE THEM AGAINST THE REST OF US AND IT'S

203
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,949

INTERSECTION BETWEEN YOUR CASE

SPECIFICALLY WHICH IS ABOUT IN

215
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,129
VALIDATING AN NDA AND THAT RAID ON

216
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,099
MONDAY WELL IT COULD BE BY WAY OF MONEY

217
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,680
LAUNDRY IT COULD BE WITH MY WAY A BANK

218
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,169
FRAUD OR IT COULD BE BY WAY OF CAMPAIGN

219
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,960
FINANCE VIOLATIONS AS IT RELATES TO THIS

220
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,610
130 THOUSAND DOLLAR PAYMENT AL CAPONE

221
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,110
WAS NOT CONVICTED OF MURDER HE WAS

CONVICTED OF TAX EVASION HE'S IN A CIVIL

223
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,469
MATTER INVOLVING THE PRESIDENT AND

224
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:03,779
MICHAEL COHEN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM

225
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,029
WEIGHING IN ON THIS OTHER CRIMINAL CASE

226
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,169
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MICHAEL EVAN

227
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,060
ODD HE'S LAWYERING UP TO THIS POINT WELL

228
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,860
HE'S MAKING MY POINT COMPLETELY THAT IS

229
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,659
YOU CAN FIND CRIMES ANYWHERE IF YOU LOOK

230
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,370
HARD ENOUGH HE'S ALREADY LOOKING AND

231
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,680
FINDING CRIMES MONEY LAUNDERING BANK

232
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,909
FRAUD WHAT ELSE YOU KNOW YOU CAN FIND

233
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,919
CRIMES IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH IT WAS I

234
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,529
THINK BURIAL OF RANDY BERRY THE HEAD OF

235
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,509
THE KGB WHO SAID TO STALIN SHOW ME THE

236
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,360
MAN AND I'LL FIND YOU THE CRIME SPECIAL

237
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,190
PROSECUTORS COMPLAINING LIKE 1192 THE

238
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,828
KGB NO NO NO I'M NOT I'M JUST SAYING YOU

239
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:35,969
CAN FIND CRIMES

240
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,309
THAT'S WHY CIVIL LIBERTARIANS HAVE TO BE

241
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,839
CONCERNED IS HE BEING AN EFFECTIVE

242
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,860
LAWYER HERE HE IS

243
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,448
HE'S BEING A TOUGH LAWYER EFFECTIVE

244
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:45,990
LAWYERS REPRESENTING HIS CLIENT AND HE'S

245
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,770
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

246
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,110
CIVIL MATTERS CAN TURN INTO CRIMINAL

247
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,500
MATTER

248
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,810
ASK BILL CLINTON AND BEFORE I LET YOU GO

249
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,670
AND ALSO TURN TO MY WYLIE FOR HER TAKE

250
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,430
ON MUCH OF THIS I HAVE TO GET INTO THE

251
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,050
FAMOUS COLLUSION QUESTION BECAUSE YOU

252
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,850
HAVE ARGUED VERY FORCEFULLY AND ON THE

253
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,230
BEAT SPECIAL WE DID ABOUT THIS AS YOU

254
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,330
MAY RECALL THAT PEOPLE OVERSTATE

255
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,010
COLLUSION AS A PROCESS THAT IS IN A

256
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,110
CRIME BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS NEW REPORT

257
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,580
IN MCCLATCHY WHICH NBC I WANT TO BE VERY

258
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,890
CLEAR HAS NOT VERIFIED THAT SAYS THEY

259
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,660
HAVE SOURCES ABOUT MULLER FINDING

260
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,670
EVIDENCE THAT MICHAEL COHEN DID GO TO

261
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,890
PRAGUE DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHERE THERE

262
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,420
IS AN ALLEGATION THAT HE MAY HAVE

263
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,300
STRATEGIZED WITH A KREMLIN FIGURE ABOUT

264
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,660
RUSSIAN MEDDLING INCLUDING POTENTIAL

265
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,870
FELONIOUS EMAIL HACKING IF THAT KIND OF

266
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,280
THING COMES ON THE BOARD IF THERE'S

267
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,290
EVIDENCE OF THAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS

268
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,430
THE KIND OF CRIME THAT'S CONNECTED TO

269
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,050
COLLUSION LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT

270
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,300
DEPENDS ON WHAT HE MEANS BY RUSSIAN

271
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,860
HACKING IF THE RUSSIAN HACKING ALREADY

272
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,830
OCCURRED AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAID OH

273
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,620
YOU'VE HACKED GIVE US THE INFORMATION WE

274
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,540
WANT TO USE IT THAT'S LIKE THE NEW YORK

275
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,130
TIMES PUBLISHING MANNING SNOWDEN AND THE

276
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,860
PENTAGON PAPERS IF ON THE OTHER HAND HE

277
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,050
SAID HACK LET ME TELL YOU WHO TO HACK

278
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,910
HERE'S THE REPUBLICAN THE DEMOCRATIC

279
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,540
NATIONAL COMMITTEE

280
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,850
OF COURSE THAT'S ACCESSORY TO A FELONY

281
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,320
THAT WOULD BE ACCESSORY TO FELONY THAT'S

282
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,760
PROFESSOR ALAN DERSHOWITZ WE ALWAYS

283
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,380
LEARN A LOT FROM YOU HEARING ABOUT YOU

284
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,730
HEARING ABOUT YOUR HATERS HEARING YOUR

285
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,020
ANALYSIS I APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON THE

286
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,540
BEAT SIR THANK YOU MAYA I WANT TO TURN

287
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,700
TO YOU WE WENT THROUGH A LOT

288
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,440
PICKING UP THOUGH ON THE PROG POINT THIS

289
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,970
IS A PLACE WHERE MICHAEL COHEN COULD

290
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,220
HAVE EXPOSURE THAT RELATES BACK TO THE

291
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,900
THING THAT MULLER IS INVESTIGATING

292
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,240
ABSOLUTELY AND FIRST OF ALL HE ALSO MAY

293
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,030
HAVE A PERJURY CHARGE OR CHARGES ADDED

294
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,890
DEPENDING ON WHAT HE HAD SAID UNDER OATH

295
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,810
AROUND PRAGUE HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE

296
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,270
VOCAL ABOUT SAYING I DIDN'T DO IT I

297
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,660
DIDN'T GO WE DON'T KNOW AND I THINK IT'S

298
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,190
IMPORTANT TO SAY WE DON'T KNOW BUT

299
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,760
CERTAINLY IF HE DID GO THEN THE QUESTION

300
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,950
IS WHAT HAPPENED THERE WHAT WERE THE

301
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,650
CONVERSATIONS IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE A

302
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,420
LONG PROCESS AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

303
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,580
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO LET THE PROCESS

304
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,640
PLAY OUT WITHOUT MAKING CONCLUSIONS BUT

305
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,230
I WOULD SAY MICHAEL COHEN HAS A LOT TO

306
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,060
WORRY ABOUT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

307
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,260
SEAN HANNITY EMPLOYING OR HAVING LEGAL

308
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,030
WORK DONE BY SO MANY TRUMP LAWYERS WHICH

309
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,400
IS SOMETHING I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE

310
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,410
COVERING TONIGHT WELL THERE'S NOTHING

311
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,790
ILLEGAL ABOUT WHO YOU CHOOSE AS YOUR

312
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,190
LAWYER SHORT SO I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE

313
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,930
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT CONFLATING

314
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,790
THAT WITH THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

315
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,040
UNLESS OR UNTIL SOME ADDITIONAL

316
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,230
INFORMATION COMES FORWARD I THINK THE

317
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,900
FACT THAT SEAN HANNITY DID NOT DISCLOSE

318
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,300
IS IN AND OF ITSELF VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR

319
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,880
OUR DEMOCRACY AND FOR THE NOTION THAT WE

320
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,500
WILL BE TOLD WHAT KIND OF RELATIONS

321
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,240
PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY'RE COMMENTING I

322
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,850
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WITH MR. DERSHOWITZ

323
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,890
THAT THERE'S NO SECRET TO WHO HANNITY IS

324
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,260
FRIENDS WITH OR NOT FRIENDS WITH IT'S

325
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,850
NOT REALLY A CLOSED SECRET BUT IT'S

326
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,970
STILL IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE HOLD

327
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,170
JOURNALISTIC ETHICS JUST LIKE WE HOLD

328
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,760
LEGAL ETHICS JUST LIKE WE HOPE LET ME

329
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,800
ASK YOU ABOUT PROTECT ABOUT SOMETHING I

330
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
WAS LEARNING ABOUT TONIGHT I THE BEST

331
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,250
PART OF COMING ON THE BEAT IS YOU LEARN

332
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,570
THINGS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

333
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,150
DERSHOWITZ IS FOR LAWS FOR TRUMP WHO IS

334
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,770
KNOWN TO WATCH TELEVISION SO HE MAY HAVE

335
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,020
HEARD THE LAWS DON'T TWEET DON'T PARDON

336
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,870
DON'T TESTIFY AND DON'T FIRE PROSECUTORS

337
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,750
I THINK IT IS VERY SOUND ADVICE

338
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,190
IF I WERE DONALD TRUM HAS BEEN SAYING

339
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,750
ALL OF THE ABOVE TO HIM QUITE FRANK ALL

340
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,130
THE ABOVE BUT HE DOESN'T FOLLOW IT BUT

341
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,810
HE HASN'T FOLLOWED IT AND I THINK IT'S

342
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,460
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ NEWS REPORTS

343
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,680
TO KNOW HE WOULD BE IN A STRONGER

344
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,810
POSITION TODAY IF HE FOLLOWED THOSE

345
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,480
THREE PIECES OF ADVICE FINAL WORD BEFORE

346
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,970
WE GO WELL IF HE HADN'T FIRED CALL ME WE

347
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,470
WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE AND BE RIGHT

348
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,720
IN THIS WAY BUT I DO THINK THAT THE

349
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,940
DEFENSE TEAM HAS BEEN FOCUSING TOO MUCH

350
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,680
ATTENTION ON THE COMEY INVESTIGATION OF

351
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,780
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND COLLUSION

352
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,130
WHERE I DON'T THINK HE HAS AS MUCH

353
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,650
VULNERABILITY AS THE POTENTIAL

354
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,870
VULNERABILITY FOR PRE PRESIDENTIAL

355
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,210
ACTIVITIES OF A BUSINESS AND AN

356
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,100
ALLEGEDLY SEXUAL NATURE THAT'S WHERE

357
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,260

359
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,680
WITH YOU MR. DERSH WOODS BECAUSE I THINK

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,330
THERE REALLY IS A LOT MORE INDICATION

361
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,070
THAT THEY MAY THEY MAY OR MAY BE SOME

362
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,330
SERIOUS CRIMES HERE THAT HAVE BEEN

363
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,920
COMMITTED AND THAT IT IS CRITICALLY

364

SEEING HERE IF COMEY HAD NOT BEEN FIRED

366
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,020
I JUST THINK THE OBSTRUCTION CHARGE

367
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,550
WOULD NOT BE ONE OF THE CHARGES RIGHT

368
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,410
