00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:13,803
BOOKER WAS MAKING, THAT THIS NOMINEE WAS CHOSEN OFF A LIST,

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,405
NOMINEE WAS CHOSEN OFF A LIST, AN UNUSUAL THING.

8
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,140
AN UNUSUAL THING. THIS PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,808
THIS PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WOULD CHOOSE NOMINEES FROM A

10
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,712
WOULD CHOOSE NOMINEES FROM A LIST PREPARED BY CONSERVATIVE

11
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:26,816
LIST PREPARED BY CONSERVATIVE INTEREST GROUPS.

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,452
INTEREST GROUPS. HE IS SAYING THAT HE IS THE ONE

13
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,888
HE IS SAYING THAT HE IS THE ONE PERSON ON THAT LIST WHO IS

14
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,689
PERSON ON THAT LIST WHO IS EXPLICITLY ON THE RECORD TALKING

15
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,325
EXPLICITLY ON THE RECORD TALKING ABOUT A PRESIDENT’S LIABILITY TO

16
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,793
ABOUT A PRESIDENT’S LIABILITY TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND

17
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,227
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND INDICTMENT.

18
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,696
INDICTMENT. AND SAYING, AS SENATOR BOOKER.

19
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,231
AND SAYING, AS SENATOR BOOKER. THAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE

20
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,766
THAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE SUBL TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,401
SUBL TO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND CANNOT BE INDICTED.

22
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,136
AND CANNOT BE INDICTED. IF HE IS THE ONE GUY FROM THAT

23
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,438
IF HE IS THE ONE GUY FROM THAT LIST OF 2000 CHOICES WHO HAS

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,640
LIST OF 2000 CHOICES WHO HAS BEEN EXPLICIT ON THAT POINT, IS

25
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,643
BEEN EXPLICIT ON THAT POINT, IS THAT THE SIGNAL ELEMENT THAT WE

26
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,945
THAT THE SIGNAL ELEMENT THAT WE SHOULD SEE HERE IN THIS CHOICE?

27
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,749
SHOULD SEE HERE IN THIS CHOICE? JOINING US ONCE AGAIN, LEGAL

28
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,017
JOINING US ONCE AGAIN, LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AT SLATE.COM.

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,453
CORRESPONDENT AT SLATE.COM. TO THIS POINT IS SENATOR BOOKER

30
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,021
TO THIS POINT IS SENATOR BOOKER CORRECT THAT KAVANAUGH HAS AN

31
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:09,459
CORRECT THAT KAVANAUGH HAS AN AND MISSION IT OVERT RECORD THAT

32
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,160
AND MISSION IT OVERT RECORD THAT MIGHT APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT

33
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,662
MIGHT APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF HIS OWN LEGAL WOES?

34
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,330
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN LEGAL WOES? >> I THINK IF THE PRESIDENT WERE

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,065
>> I THINK IF THE PRESIDENT WERE POURING OVER THE WRITINGS OF

36
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,568
POURING OVER THE WRITINGS OF EVERY PERSON ON THE LIST, JUDGE

37
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,069
EVERY PERSON ON THE LIST, JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM

38
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,203
KAVANAUGH WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MOST SUCKER.

39
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,040
MOST SUCKER. I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING.

40
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,375
I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING. IN THE ARTICLE WHERE HE TALKED

41
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,678
IN THE ARTICLE WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT THIS, HE DIDN’T SAY AS A

42
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,079
ABOUT THIS, HE DIDN’T SAY AS A CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER THE

43
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,980
CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMMUNE FROM

44
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,583
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMMUNE FROM ALL CIVIL AND LIABILITY.

45
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,584
ALL CIVIL AND LIABILITY. HE SAID CONGRESS SHOULD PASS A

46
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:39,924
HE SAID CONGRESS SHOULD PASS A LAW TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT.

47
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,692
LAW TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT. I DON’T THINK HE WAS MAKING THE

48
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,960
I DON’T THINK HE WAS MAKING THE CONSTITUTIONAL POINT THAT IS

49
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,894
CONSTITUTIONAL POINT THAT IS QUITE SO BROAD.

50
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,731
QUITE SO BROAD. >> HE’S MAKING A MILL ARGUMENT

51
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,800
>> HE’S MAKING A MILL ARGUMENT THAT THE IMPEACHMENT OF A

52
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,602
THAT THE IMPEACHMENT OF A PRESIDENT WOULD PUT A PROSECUTOR

53
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:56,607
PRESIDENT WOULD PUT A PROSECUTOR IN THE PLACE OF SUPPLANTING

54
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,408
IN THE PLACE OF SUPPLANTING CONGRESS’ RESPONSIBILITY TO

55
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:57,742
CONGRESS’ RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPEACH.

56
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,976
IMPEACH. >> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

57
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,012
>> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS NOT QUITE AS

58
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,680
BECAUSE IT IS NOT QUITE AS DISPOSITIVE OF THIS QUESTION AS

59
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,481
DISPOSITIVE OF THIS QUESTION AS WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK.

60
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:08,186
WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK. ON YOUR QUESTION, IF YOU THINK

61
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:11,122
ON YOUR QUESTION, IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH FIRE KAVANAUGH

62
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,024
ABOUT HOW MUCH FIRE KAVANAUGH DREW.

63
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:13,724
DREW. TED CRUZ HATED HIM.

64
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,160
TED CRUZ HATED HIM. WE HAD THEM SAYING, WE WON’T BE

65
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,895
WE HAD THEM SAYING, WE WON’T BE FOR TRUMP IF HE PUTS KAVANAUGH

66
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:18,229
FOR TRUMP IF HE PUTS KAVANAUGH UP.

67
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,332
UP. WHAT WAS THE RESISTANCE TO

68
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:21,732
WHAT WAS THE RESISTANCE TO KAVANAUGH?

69
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:22,533
KAVANAUGH? IT HAS BEEN REALLY INTERESTING

70
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:23,000
IT HAS BEEN REALLY INTERESTING TO ME.

71
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,136
TO ME. I THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS

72
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,206
I THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS JUST THAT HE WASN’T A SORT OF

73
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,207
JUST THAT HE WASN’T A SORT OF RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE.

74
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,409
RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE. THIS WASN’T GOING TO BE THE

75
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,244
THIS WASN’T GOING TO BE THE FIREFIGHT THAT SOME OF THE

76
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:38,082
FIREFIGHT THAT SOME OF THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY WANTED.

77
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:41,219
EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY WANTED. TED CRUZ HAS BEEN WARNING THAT

78
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:46,558
TED CRUZ HAS BEEN WARNING THAT HE’S GOING TO BE A SUITOR.

79
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,660
HE’S GOING TO BE A SUITOR. >> ARE THERE ANY INDICATIONS, HE

80
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,663
>> ARE THERE ANY INDICATIONS, HE HAS MORE THAN 300 OPINIONS.

81
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:57,302
HAS MORE THAN 300 OPINIONS. HE’S BEEN ON THE APPEALS COURT

82
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,370
HE’S BEEN ON THE APPEALS COURT FOR A DOZEN YEARS.

83
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:02,740
FOR A DOZEN YEARS. VERY IDEOLOGICALLY CHARGED.

84
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,378
VERY IDEOLOGICALLY CHARGED. HE WAS BUSH-GORE RECOUNT LAWYER.

85
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,979
HE WAS BUSH-GORE RECOUNT LAWYER. A GEORGE W. BUSH WHITE HOUSE

86
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,050
A GEORGE W. BUSH WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE FOR MORE THAN FOUR

87
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,385
EMPLOYEE FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS.

88
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:15,387
YEARS. WHAT WOULD ALLOW CONSERVATIVE

89
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:18,657
WHAT WOULD ALLOW CONSERVATIVE CRITICS TO SEE HIM THAT WAY?

90
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,392
CRITICS TO SEE HIM THAT WAY? >> I HAVE NO IDEA BUT I WAS

91
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,160
>> I HAVE NO IDEA BUT I WAS STUNNED WITH HOW THEY CAME OUT

92
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:23,461
STUNNED WITH HOW THEY CAME OUT AGAINST HIM AND I THINK THAT

93
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:24,896
AGAINST HIM AND I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS MAKING EXACTLY

94
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,266
DONALD TRUMP WAS MAKING EXACTLY THE CALCULUS YOU JUST

95
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,700
THE CALCULUS YOU JUST IDENTIFIED.

96
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,502
IDENTIFIED. IF I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO

00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,604
IF I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO MOLLIFY, I HAVE ALL THESE GROUPS

98
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:33,738
MOLLIFY, I HAVE ALL THESE GROUPS ANGRY ABOUT SOMEONE.

99
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:37,275
ANGRY ABOUT SOMEONE. I AM GOING TO PROTECT MYSELF.

100
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,511
I AM GOING TO PROTECT MYSELF. I AM GOING TO FICK GUY WHO WROTE

101
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,913
I AM GOING TO FICK GUY WHO WROTE MOST EXPANSIVELY OVER YEARS WHAT

102
00:03:41,957 --> 00:03:44,716
MOST EXPANSIVELY OVER YEARS WHAT THE SCOPE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER

103
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:44,983
THE SCOPE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER IS.

104
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:49,121
IS. IN THAT SENSE YOU SEE TRUMP NOT

105
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:55,527
IN THAT SENSE YOU SEE TRUMP NOT LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE OF

106
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:56,028
LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE OF THAT.

107
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,629
